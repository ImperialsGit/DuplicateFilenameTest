# DuplicateFilenameTest
Very strange code phenomenon. Allows duplicate flienames in the directory provided

Just enter the full path of any file (including extension), and the program will anomalously create a second file with the same name and extension in the same directory.
Do I know how? No. Do I know why? No. Please help.
